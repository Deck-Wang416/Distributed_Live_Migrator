# Distributed_Live_Migrator
A distributed deep learning training tool developed based on the FairScale framework, designed to enable real-time migration of BERT-Base training tasks across multiple nodes.

## BERT Training with Transformers
This project demonstrates how to train a BERT model for binary classification using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Prepare the dataset: Place `dataset.csv` in the `data/` folder.
3. Train the model: `python scripts/train.py`
4. Evaluate the model: `python scripts/evaluate.py`
